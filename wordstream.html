				<h2>PPC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) Marketing</h2>
				<p><span>PPC</span> (<a href="" target="_blank">pay-per click</a>) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span>PPC Automation</span> - While it would be impoosible(and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of <a href="" target="_blank">pay-per-click advertising</a>, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your business.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>PPC Management</span> - <a href="" target="_blank">PPC management</a> refers to the maintenance and prioritization of <a href="" target="_blank">paid search</a> marketing tasks. Being able to oversee various aspects of your account while assigning each item on a seemingly endless to-do list an appropriate value can make or break an <a href="" target="_blank">online ad campaign</a>.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<p>WordStream's <a href="" target="_blank">PPC software</a> is specifically designed to aid in these two <a href="" target="_blank">PPC search engine</a> marketing areas. This page will show you both the processes the software is automating for you, and the best course of action to take where workflow is concerned.</p>
